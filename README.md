# Vendor-Health-Management-Portal
## Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable vendor monitoring, control, and failover management portal designed to improve reliability, visibility, and operational efficiency for airtime and data service integrations.

The system addresses the challenges of limited real-time visibility into vendor performance and the risks associated with manual intervention during vendor outages.

## Problem Statement

The organization integrates with multiple vendors to provide airtime and data services. Prior to this solution:

- There was low real-time visibility into vendor health and failure patterns

- Vendor failures were often detected reactively, after customer impact

- Failing vendors were disabled using manual SQL update scripts

- The process was:

  - Error-prone
  
  - Slow to respond
  
 -  Not auditable
  
  - Not scalable as vendor count increased

- There was no centralized view of:

  - Success vs failure rates
  
  - API call volumes
  
  - Vendor-specific performance trends
  
  - SLA adherence
  
This resulted in increased downtime, delayed incident response, and operational inefficiencies.
